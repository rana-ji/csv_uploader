CSV File Upload and Search Node.js Project
    A Node.js application to upload and search CSV files.

Features:-
    Upload any CSV file with the delimiter as a comma ‘,’.
    Display a list of all uploaded CSV files.
    When the user selects a file, display all the data (with column headers) in a table on the front-end.
    Implement a search box that searches the matching rows of the table and displays only the data that matches the search query (empty search box displays all data).
    Table headers are dynamic, and different CSV files with different column headers can be uploaded.
    Implement front-end and server-side validation to upload only CSV files.
